<bodycontent>

This 1-hour talk introduces students to Generative Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) from a **learning-centered perspective**, focusing on how these technologies can be used to *enhance understanding, critical thinking, and study effectiveness* rather than replace cognitive effort.  

Key questions explored include:  

* What is Generative AI, and how does it differ from traditional AI and search-based systems?  
* How do Large Language Models work at a conceptual level, and what can they realistically support in learning?  
* How does the level of automation influence understanding, performance, and skill development?  
* How can GenAI be used to support metacognition, explanation, summarization, and concept mastery without undermining learning?  


<h3>Target Audience</h3>
Undergraduate and graduate students, as well as educators, with a basic technical background and familiarity with AI, Machine Learning, or Computer Science concepts.  
The talk includes practical examples and guided exercises that students can immediately apply to their own study routines.


<h3>Proposed Structure</h3>
* Topic 1 – Generative AI and Learning.  
* Topic 2 – Making the Best Use of GenAI.  
* Topic 3 – Applying the Right Voice.  
* Topic 4 – Turning GenAI into a Study Partner.
