Thank you for your interest in collaborating with our lab!

We strive to bring together like-minded innovators and Multi-Disciplinary research groups.

You can collaborate with the Lab in one of the following capacities:

* [Research Collaborators](#research-collaborators)
* [Industry Partners](#industry-partner)
* [Ph.D. Candidates](#phd-students)
* [Master Researcher](#master-researcher)
* [Undergraduate Researcher](#undergradute-researcher)

<br/>

### Some Ideas

* [Ideas for Scientific Research Explorations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kvDZFpP_bHImJSLeVpZmmEuLd-EIC-J9aWbqgIITpFI/edit?usp=sharing): where you can look for pointers to potentially interesting research question and their contribution to the state-of-the-art.

* [Ideas for Industry-related Use Cases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ge2chxRrBjILHkZthtzymqAbs3TkwrGiMMge23zC8jA/edit?usp=sharing): open science catalog of real-world use cases developed along with our industry partners and through interviews with 

* [Candidate Projects](./projects.md#candidate-projects): these are project ideas sourced from our Collaborators; it is always a good idea to engage in multidiscipliary projects to start strong.
