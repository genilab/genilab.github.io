Thank you for your interest in collaborating with our lab!

We strive to bring together like-minded innovators and Multi-Disciplinary research groups to make our work meaningful for the society!

You can join us in one of the following capacities:

* [Research Collaborators](#research-collaborators)
* [Industry Partner](#industry-partner)
* [Postdoc Researchers](#postdoctoral-researchers)
* [Ph.D. Students](#phd-students)
* [Master Researcher](#master-researcher)
* [Undergraduate Researcher](#undergradute-researcher)
* [Contributor](./contribute.md)


> Note: please reach out to [Dr. Koch](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/directory/faculty/koch/) with a short message about your interests and the project you'd like to develop with us.

### Project Ideas

* [BlueSky Ideas](https://padlet.com/generativeintelligencelab/ideas): these are less technical projects developed in collaboration with multidisciplinary researchers. Ideal for creative thinkers and those interested in broader social, philosophical, or artistic implications of Generative Intelligence.

* [Use Case Compendium](http://bit.ly/genilab-compendium): provides a practical catalog of real-world use cases aimed at guiding applied exercises and lightweight experiments. These are suitable for people looking to understand or demonstrate the value of generative systems in business or everyday settings.

* [Scientific Research Projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kvDZFpP_bHImJSLeVpZmmEuLd-EIC-J9aWbqgIITpFI/edit?usp=sharing): these projects are more complex and focus on pushing the boundaries of generative models, learning dynamics, or system safety. For those interested in foundational research, algorithmic innovation, or system-level thinking.

### Research Collaborators


For that, we seek to engage with Research Collaborators from other Department in our Research Community that can contribute with one or more of the following:

* Joint Grant Applications is our top-priority.
* Ideas for Socially-Relevant Prototypes applying our Research resources for fast prototyping.
* Create Use Cases, specially around multi-disciplinary research.
* Promote Publications, always important to showcase our interests and capabilities.


### Industry Partners

We seek to collaborate with Industry Partners that can help with:

* Create Industry-relevant Use Cases.
* Ideas for Industry-Relevant Prototypes applying our Research resources for fast prototyping.
* Joint Grant Applications.


### Postdoctoral Researchers

> Note: We DO NOT have financial support available at the moment.

We are continuously looking into financial support to be able to create PostDoc opportunities. 

If you would like to put together a proposal, we are more than happy to support.


### PhD Students

> Note: We DO NOT have opportunities with financial support. 

We are always interested in working with passionate and self-driven PhD candidates!

We are open to:
* Supervising PhD research.
* Providing mentorship and advisory.

When you reach out, please provide a preliminary view about (see [examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kvDZFpP_bHImJSLeVpZmmEuLd-EIC-J9aWbqgIITpFI/edit?usp=sharing)):
