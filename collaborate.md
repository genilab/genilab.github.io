## Project Ideas


* [Project Ideas](https://padlet.com/generativeintelligencelab/ideas): these are ideas being developed  in collaboration with multidisciplinary researchers. 

* [Ideas for Industry-related Use Cases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ge2chxRrBjILHkZthtzymqAbs3TkwrGiMMge23zC8jA/edit?usp=sharing): provides a practical catalog of real-world use cases aimed at guiding applied exercises and lightweight experiments.

* [Ideas for Scientific Research Projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kvDZFpP_bHImJSLeVpZmmEuLd-EIC-J9aWbqgIITpFI/edit?usp=sharing): these projects are more complex and focus on pushing the boundaries of generative models, learning dynamics, or system safety.

## Industry Partners

We seek to collaborate with Industry Partners that can help with:

* Bring in your technology as a Research Resource for experimentation.
* Develop experiments to generate datasets of relevant research data. 
* Create Industry-relevant Use Cases.
* Joint Grant Applications.

What should I do?
1. Reach out to [Dr. Koch](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/directory/faculty/koch/) with a short message about your interest.
1. If you already have a project in mind, compile a preliminary proposal (1-pager) including:
    * Title 
    * Challenge
    * Strategy (*)

Where for 'Strategy':
* What do we have to put together? 
* Are you bringing in your technology? 
* Are we developing experiments?
