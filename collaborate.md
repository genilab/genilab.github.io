## Research Collaborators

We need to bring together like-minded innovators and Multi-Disciplinary research groups to make our work meaningful for the society!

For that, we seek to engage with Research Collaborators from other Department in our Research Community that can contribute with one or more of the following:

1. **Joint Grant Applications** is our top-priority.
1. **Ideas for Socially-Relevant Prototypes** applying our Research resources for fast prototyping.
1. **Create Use Cases**, specially around multi-disciplinary research.
1. **Promote Publications**, always important to showcase our interests and capabilities.

## Industry Partners

We need to make our research and development relevant to the industry, so it will have true impact!

In practical terms, we seek to collaborate with Industry Partners that can help with:

1. **Create Industry-relevant Use Cases**.
1. **Ideas for Industry-Relevant Prototypes** applying our Research resources for fast prototyping.
1. **Joint Grant Applications**.

## Postdoctoral Researchers

> Note: We DO NOT have financial support available at the moment.

We are continuously looking into financial support to be able to create PostDoc opportunities. If you would like to put together a proposal, we are more than happy to support.

Please contact [Dr. Koch](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/directory/faculty/koch/).

## PhD Students

> Note: We DO NOT have opportunities with financial support. 

We are always interested in working with passionate and self-driven PhD candidates!

We are open to:
* **Supervising PhD research** .
* **Providing mentorship and advisory**.

Check [Dr. Kochâ€™s Philosophy on Academic Advisory](http://www.fernandokoch.me/pages/advisory.html) with guidelines and to set the expectations.

If you are interested, please reach out proving:
* Title 
* Abstract
* Intriguing Research Question
* Why is this question relevant?
* How are you planning to answer it?

## Masters Researcher

We welcome Master's students who wish to conduct their dissertation research within the lab. 

We are open to:
1. **Supervise Master Research**.
1. **Provide Mentorship and Advisory**.
1. **Guidance for Structuring Projects** around Multi-disciplinary Research agendas.
1. **Help to find a Multi-disciplinary Research Collaborator**


If you are already a registered Master Student at FAU, one way to (voluntarily) participating is by engaging in a Multi-disciplinary Research Project. We DO NOT have opportunities for RAs, unfortunately. However, financial opportunities will come through Research Collaborations and Industry Partners (and Use Cases they want to build).

**We are builders!**
One way to facilitate the process is to **help finding Research Collaboration projects**, for instance, through access with Collaborators in other Departments. We are open to fully support this process!

Another way to collaborate is to **align your Master Research** with the **Creation of Use Cases** and/or **Contribute to our Research Resources**.

If you are interested, please contact [Dr. Koch](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/directory/faculty/koch/).

## Undergraduate Researcher

If you are an undergraduate student at FAU and curious about Generative Artificial Intelligence, Intelligent Chat Bots, Synthetic Content Creation, and other related topics, we would love to hear from you! 

We are open to:
1. **Support Final Year Projects**.
1. **Provide Mentorship and Advisory**.
1. **Guidance for Structuring Projects** around Multi-disciplinary Research agendas.

Please contact [Dr. Koch](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/directory/faculty/koch/). Check the lists of use cases and research ideas in 'Pointers and Guidelines' (see above).
