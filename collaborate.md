Thank you for your interest in collaborating with our lab!

We strive to bring together like-minded innovators and Multi-Disciplinary research groups.

You can collaborate with the Lab in one of the following capacities:

* [Research Collaborators](#research-collaborators)
* [Industry Partner](#industry-partner)
* [Ph.D. Students](#phd-students)
* [Master Researcher](#master-researcher)
* [Undergraduate Researcher](#undergradute-researcher)
* [Contributor](./contribute.md)


Note: Master's and PhD students should (i) check the 'conditions' below and (ii) complete the [Expression of Interest Form (Master's & PhDs)](https://forms.gle/eY8FQmdfyytD3Hjq9).

### Project Ideas

* [Project Ideas](https://padlet.com/generativeintelligencelab/ideas): these are ideas being developed  in collaboration with multidisciplinary researchers. Ideal for creative thinkers and those interested in broader social, philosophical, or artistic implications of Generative Intelligence.

* [Ideas for Scientific Research Projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kvDZFpP_bHImJSLeVpZmmEuLd-EIC-J9aWbqgIITpFI/edit?usp=sharing): these projects are more complex and focus on pushing the boundaries of generative models, learning dynamics, or system safety. For those interested in foundational research, algorithmic innovation, or system-level thinking.

* [Ideas for Industry-related Use Cases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ge2chxRrBjILHkZthtzymqAbs3TkwrGiMMge23zC8jA/edit?usp=sharing): provides a practical catalog of real-world use cases aimed at guiding applied exercises and lightweight experiments. These are suitable for people looking to understand or demonstrate the value of generative systems in business or everyday settings.

### Industry Partners

We seek to collaborate with Industry Partners that can help with:

* Bring in your technology as a Research Resource for experimentation.
* Develop experiments to generate datasets of relevant research data. 
* Create Industry-relevant Use Cases.
* Joint Grant Applications.

What must I do?
1. Reach out to [Dr. Koch](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/directory/faculty/koch/) with a short message about your interest.
1. If you already have a project in mind, compile a preliminary proposal (1-pager) including:
    * Title 
    * Challenge
    * Strategy (*)

Where for 'Strategy':
* What do we have to put together? 
* Are you bringing in your technology? 
* Are we developing experiments?
