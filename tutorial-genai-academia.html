This talk (~ 1-hour) introduces the core concepts, capabilities, and practical applications of Generative Intelligence in scientific research.  
It is designed for a non-technical audience and aims to promote an understanding of Generative AI as an enabler for new forms of **interaction, collaboration, and creativity** in research.  

* What is Generative Intelligence, and how does it differ from traditional AI approaches?  
* How can GenAI support scientific research for non-technical users?  
* How can Generative AI assist in analyzing and interpreting results?  
* How can scientists begin exploring GenAI tools (beyond chatbots)?  

<h3>Target Audience</h3>
This talk is intended for faculty, researchers, and students from non-technical backgrounds who are interested in exploring the role of Generative Intelligence in scientific research.  

<h3>Proposed Structure</h3>
* Topic 1 - Understanding Generative Intelligence:
* Topic 2 - Using GenAI in Research 
* Topic 3 - Interacting Better with Generative Intelligence
* Topic 4 - AI-Driven Research:
