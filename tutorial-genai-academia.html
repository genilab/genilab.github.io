This tutorial (1-2 hours) introduces the core concepts, capabilities, and practical applications of Generative Intelligence in scientific research, with a special focus on multi-disciplinary projects.  
It is designed for a non-technical audience and aims to promote an understanding of Generative AI as an enabler for new forms of **interaction, collaboration, and creativity** in research.  

* What is Generative Intelligence, and how does it differ from traditional AI approaches?  
* How can GenAI support scientific research across disciplines, particularly for non-technical users?  
* How can Generative AI assist in analyzing and interpreting unstructured data such as text, images, or video?  
* How can scientists begin exploring and applying GenAI tools effectively in their own work?  

<h3>Target Audience</h3>
This talk is intended for faculty, researchers, and students from non-technical backgrounds who are interested in exploring the role of Generative Intelligence in scientific research.  

<h3>Proposed Structure</h3>
* Topic 1 - Understanding Generative Intelligence: What Generative AI is and why it matters in research.  
* Topic 2 - GenAI in Research Applications: How Generative AI can support academic exploration, data analysis, and interdisciplinary collaboration.  
* Topic 3 - Interacting Better with Generative Intelligence: Basic view of prompt engineering and how to write clear and simple instructions to get useful, relevant results.  
* Topic 4 - AI-Driven Research: Understanding how AI systems can act as active collaborators in research and academic innovation.
