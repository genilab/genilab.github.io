This workshop (2-days) provides a deep dive on Generative Intelligence and how it is transforming the way organizations design, execute, and scale business processes. 
Participants will learn the core concepts behind GenAI and agentic AI, explore real-world workflows and case studies, and leave with repeatable frameworks for moving from experimentation to AI-first and ultimately AI-native operating models.
  
* What is Generative Intelligence, and how does it differ from traditional AI used in business?  
* How can startups and entrepreneurs use GenAI to ideate, prototype, and launch new products or services?
