## Tutorials

We provide tutorials aimed at promoting knowledge sharing and advancing education in the field of Generative Intelligence. Our tutorials blend theory, practical insights, and real-world applications to equip the community with the tools to innovate and collaborate.

* [**TUTORIAL - Generative Intelligence in Academic Projects**](./pdfs/TUTORIAL%20Generative%20Intelligence%20in%20Academic%20Projects.pdf): introduces the core concepts, capabilities, and practical applications of Generative Intelligence in scientific research, with a special focus on multi-disciplinary projects. The session is designed for a **non-technical audience** and aims to promote an understanding of Generative AI as an enabler for new forms of interaction, collaboration, and creativity in research. 

* [**TUTORIAL - Generative Intelligence and Business**](./pdfs/TUTORIAL%20Generative%20Intelligence%20and%20Business%20.pdf): this tutorial demonstrate how Generative Intelligence Systems operate to reshape business processes, open new business opportunities, and augment or create innovative applications. It is designed for a **business audience with a non-technical background**, and promotes an understanding of Generative AI as a strategic enablerâ€”helping organizations re-imagine interaction, support business missions, and unlock new value.

* [**TUTORIAL - Generative Intelligence and Software Development Lifecycles**](./pdfs/TUTORIAL%20Generative%20Intelligence%20and%20Software%20Development%20Lifecycles.pdf): examines how GenAI transforms traditional and modern software development processes, current perceptions of GenAI in software development, and impact for developers, solution architects, and startup founders. The tutorial covers topics around Generative Artificial Intelligence, Large Generative Models, Agentic Frameworks, and Multi-Agent Systems, when applied for Solution Development. The tutorial is designed for audience with **strong technical background** and  understanding about AI, Machine Learning,and programming. Note: this tutorial is offered in two formats: [half-day](./pdfs/TUTORIAL%20Generative%20Intelligence%20and%20Business%20.pdf) and [short-tutorial](./pdfs/TUTORIAL%20Generative%20Intelligence%20and%20SDLC%20(SHORT).pdf).

* [**TUTORIAL - Generative Intelligence and Large Generative Models**](./pdfs/TUTORIAL%20Generative%20AI%20and%20Large%20Generative%20Models.pdf): revises the concepts and applications of Generative Artificial Intelligence, Large Generative Models, Agentic Frameworks, and Multi-Agent Systems. This tutorial is designed for researchers, students, and practitioners with **strong technical background** and some understanding about AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and programming.
