* [TUTORIAL - Generative Intelligence in Academic Projects](./pdfs/TUTORIAL%20Generative%20Intelligence%20in%20Academic%20Projects.pdf): introduces the core concepts, capabilities, and practical applications of Generative Intelligence in scientific research, with a special focus on multi-disciplinary projects. 

* [TUTORIAL - Generative Intelligence and Business](./pdfs/TUTORIAL%20Generative%20Intelligence%20and%20Business%20.pdf): this tutorial demonstrate how Generative Intelligence Systems operate to reshape business processes, open new business opportunities, and augment or create innovative applications.

* [TUTORIAL - Generative Intelligence and Software Development Lifecycles](./pdfs/TUTORIAL%20Generative%20Intelligence%20and%20Business%20.pdf): examines how GenAI transforms traditional and modern software development processes, current perceptions of GenAI in software development, and impact for developers, solution architects, and startup founders. 

* [TUTORIAL - Generative Intelligence and Large Generative Models](./pdfs/TUTORIAL%20Generative%20AI%20and%20Large%20Generative%20Models.pdf): revises the concepts and applications of Generative Artificial Intelligence, Large Generative Models, Agentic Frameworks, and Multi-Agent Systems. 



### Publications

* [Publications by the Generative Intelligence Lab](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab) is a venue to promote publications that communicate our research insights, practical use cases, and experimental findings.

* [Research Community Papers](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/community-papers-series-ebacc91b47ea) explain the topics around our key research focus, providing an overview around the concepts, research challenges, and ideas for advanced research projects.

<!--
* [Technical Community Papers](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/technical-community-papers-bfbeda14d207): these studies are developed in collaboration with our [Research Leaders, Research Advisors, and Industry Partners](./people.html), providing technical overviews of specific topics, the impact of Generative Intelligence Systems, analysis of use cases, and ideas for explorations.
-->

* [Scientific Publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-jD2UDsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) these are publications in scientific journal, conferences, and workshops, presenting our visions, research developments, explorations, and results.
