<h2 style="color:#2B65CF">We are builders of Generative Intelligence Systems!</h2>

The Generative Intelligence Lab in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at FAU supports the design, development, and deployment of research-driven Generative Intelligence Systems for our research community and industry partners.

We operate as a *Development Studio for Generative Intelligence Systems in Multi-Disciplinary Research*, applying specialized toolkits to promote  rapid prototyping. 

<h2 style="color:#2B65CF">Advancing open science and the creative economy!</h2>

Our lab provides Research Resources tailored to emerging use cases in multidisciplinary research. We pride ourselves on being able to develop GenAI-powered systems fast and robustly. Our frameworks allow us to fast prototype solutions like:

* *Data analytic workflows* to simplify exploration, understanding, recommendation, and automated model generation for datasets in diverse fields of research. 
* *Chatbots* for personal assistants in diverse fields.
* *'Ask document' applications*, allowing natural interaction with non-structure documents. 
* *'Ask Data' applications*, providing personal assistance and automation while exploring large datasets.
* *Solutions for Multi-user Interactions*, supporting new GenAI-powered solutions in [Collective Intelligence](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/collective-intelligence-concepts-and-research-opportunities-6130ef044114). 
* .. and more.
