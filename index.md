The Generative Intelligence Lab in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at FAU supports the ideation, design, and deployment of research-driven Generative Intelligence Systems for our research community and industry partners.

### We are thinkers and builders of Generative Intelligence Systems!

We operate between a *Think Tank* and a *Development Studio* in multi-disciplinary research projects. 
We can quickly prototype solutions like:

* *Data analytic* to simplify exploration, understanding, analysis of daasets. 
* *Chatbots* for personal assistants in diverse fields.
* *Ask Document*, allowing natural interaction with non-structure documents. 
* *Ask Data*, supporting personal assistance while exploring large datasets.
* *Multi-user Interactions*, supporting GenAI-powered experiments with Collective Intelligence
(and more)

### Advancing open science and the creative economy!

Our lab builds and promotes re-usable *Research Resources* tailored to emerging use cases.
We promote regular Tutorials and Education courses to help you make the best of Generative Intelligence Systems in your field of work.
