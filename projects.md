## Operation

The Generative Intelligence Lab is a group of builders working as a software factory for Generative Intelligence Systems in Multi-Disciplinary Research Applications and Industry Collaboration.

**We favor the development of projects around Multi-Disciplinary Collaboration** and with **Industry Partners**. If you have an idea for a project or [want to join as a collaborator](,.collaborate.md), reach out to [Dr. Koch](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/directory/faculty/koch/).
