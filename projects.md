* [**VIP Enhancing Child Welfare Research and Translation through AI**](https://www.fau.edu/vip/projects/enhancing-child-welfare/): partnership project with FAU Social Works and Criminal Justice, supported by [Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) program](https://www.fau.edu/vip/); we are developing Generative Intelligence technology to make a real difference in child welfare system.

* [**Perceptions About Understanding and Skills with GenAI**](https://forms.gle/w1sm2rqZM3s8Aq3H7): we are learning how our academic community perceives their skills and confidence in using Generative AI systems and their current level of maturity with this technology. 

* [**OwlMind Framework**](https://github.com/genilab/owlmind): research platform to support education and experimentation with Generative Intelligence Systems, AI-Driven Organizations and Collective Intelligence


### Candidate Projects

* [**Small Generative Models in Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sizokJKUCZ5ZnkyXRqifDditB1SuRrwSYDo878yDxR0/edit?usp=sharing): create a laboratory to build a prototype around Small Generative Models in Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (Drone Detection). Partner: aiKOLO.

* [**AI-Native, Resilient Edge Data Mesh for Smart Energy Infrastructure**](): a new class of AI-native, resilient networking technologies to enable NextG-compatible secure mesh overlays for wireless verticals that require continuous, policy-compliant data flow across highly dynamic, intermittent, or infrastructure-limited environments. Partner: Kinnami.

* [**Sensible Games**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r9GApilXZu6UN-BkuA71VJDafYj8_WhFLZO2NWvXV2Q/edit): Experimental platform to build and test Hybrid AI models in an interactive, game-like environment. Partner: Gamepill.com.

* [**A Generative AI Framework for Human Behavior Prediction and Adaptive Multi-User Interaction in the Use Case of Proactive Engagement and Communication Optimization in Counselor Education**](.):  This proposal seeks to advance Generative Intelligence techniques that enable AI systems to model human behavior, predict needs, and facilitate adaptive multi-user interaction in real-world environments. Partner: Department of Counselor Education, FAU.

* [**Economic-Driven Multi-Agent Control for Smart Infrastructure**](): interdisciplinary research focused on designing decentralized, autonomous agents capable of real‑time coordination and adaptive decision‑making in dynamic environments. Partner: College of Business, FAU.

* [**GIS-Enhanced Multi-Agent Control for Smart-City Energy**](): create a GIS-enhanced multi-agent control system, an interconnected team of autonomous AI programs that share information and make joint decisions, to optimize sustainability in Smart Cities by integrating real-time spatial data, predictive modeling, and machine learning. Partner: College of Science FAU.

* [**Nourish to Flourish - Combatting Food Insecurity in Underserved College Students**](): a generative AI-powered culturally tailored nutrition and wellness companion, and campus-wide college student-led campaigns to enhance access to fresh, healthy food, improve robust nutrition education levels. Partner: School of Medicine, FAU.

* [**Resilient Minds - Enhancing Mental Well-being for Transitional Youth Through Trauma-Informed Care and Generative AI**](): integrate a small-scale Generative Intelligence Systems (GIS) component called “WellBot Lite,” developed in collaboration with a computer science faculty partner. This low-cost, web-based tool will guide youth through weekly wellness check-ins using generative AI prompts, offering real-time feedback like mindfulness strategies and resource links. Partner: School of Medicine, FAU.
