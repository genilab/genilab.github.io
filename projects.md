## Ideas

* [Project Ideas](https://padlet.com/generativeintelligencelab/ideas): these are ideas being developed  in collaboration with multidisciplinary researchers. 

* [Ideas for Industry-related Use Cases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ge2chxRrBjILHkZthtzymqAbs3TkwrGiMMge23zC8jA/edit?usp=sharing): provides a practical catalog of real-world use cases aimed at guiding applied exercises and lightweight experiments.

* [Ideas for Scientific Research Projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kvDZFpP_bHImJSLeVpZmmEuLd-EIC-J9aWbqgIITpFI/edit?usp=sharing): these projects are more complex and focus on pushing the boundaries of generative models, learning dynamics, or system safety.
