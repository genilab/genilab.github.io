<bodycontent>

This tutorial (2-3 hours) revises the concepts and applications of Generative Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), their foundations, evolution, and transformative impact across research and industry. We will explore how these systems operate, their core capabilities, and how they automate deliberation and assist reasoning.  

* What defines Generative AI, and how does it differ from traditional AI paradigms?  
* How do LLMs function, and what are their real-world benefits and limitations?  
* How do distributed reasoning, autonomous agents, and multi-agent systems (MAS) enable collaborative AI ecosystems?  
* Evolutions of Generative Intelligence and LLM.  

<h3>Target Audience</h3>
Researchers, students, and practitioners with technical background and good understanding about AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and programming.  
The tutorial includes practical demonstrations and exercises that attendants can implement after the session.

<h3>Proposed Structure</h3>
* Topic 1 - Foundations of Generative AI: Explores how Generative AI shifts from predictive systems toward models capable of creating, reasoning, and adapting.  
* Topic 2 - Large Generative Models: Discusses Transformer architectures, training, fine-tuning, and emergent reasoning capabilities.  
* Topic 3 - Generative AI Pipelines: Covers how LLMs are operationalized into structured, task-oriented workflows for adaptive reasoning.  
* Topic 4 - Distributed Generative AI Architectures: Explains how distributed, multi-agent frameworks enable scalable, cooperative Generative Intelligence systems.
